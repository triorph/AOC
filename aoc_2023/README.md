Doing in Rust for now

Also, I found out that supposedly we shouldn't be publishing the input_data.txt
files in the repos, which is too late because I've already mostly done this for
previous years and for most of this year (and they'd be irrevocably in the git
history). I suppose I can make a commit that gets rid of them so they're at
least not in master. I've put them in the .gitignore so at least they won't show
up in the future.
