# Advent of code 2019 day 1

Calculate the fuel cost for various rocket masses.

### Day a:
Use the formula fuel = mass /3 (rounded down) - 2, then calculate the total fuel cost for all our rocket masses individually, summed up.

### Day b:
Same as day a, except for each individual payload, add the fuel to the rocket mass and recalculate the mass requirements until it converges.
