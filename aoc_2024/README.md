# AOC 2024

Continuing in Rust for now, although aiming for a more purely functional expression of the code as per some learning of Elixir I did a few months ago.

Last year I never did finish the stupid diamond growth one, hopefully this year I'm able to go further, although might be a bit tricky with starting a new job at the exact same time as AoC. We'll see how it goes.
