## Day 10

Evaluate syntax on lines of matching and unmatching pairs.

Part a:
Calculate a syntax score for invalid lines, where a closing bracket doesn't match an opening one, based on which bracket failed.

Part b:
For valid lines, build the remaining string and calculate a syntax score for it, then find the median syntax score.
