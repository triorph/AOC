### Day 25

Cucumber march either east or south. All the east ones march first, then all the south. If there's a cucumber in the way, they'll stop.

Eventually they'll reach a full grid-lock. How many turns before this happens?

No part b for this one. My approach runs a bit slow as I'm doing a functional approach with 2 clones per iteration. Using a hashmap is easy
but probably not the most efficient.
