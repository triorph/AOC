### Advent of code 2021 - Day 8

Digits are displayed on a board of segments a b c d e f and g. Unfortunately wires are crossed and don't map correctly.
We get a bunch of digit lines, where there are 10 different examples inputs, then the actual 4 outputs. For each line, the mapping is different.

Part a: How many numbers are easily identifiable, e.g. have exactly 2 (for 1), 3 (for 7), 4 (for 4) or 7 (for 8) segments lit up.
Part b: Work out all the output numbers, then sum up what the digits are supposed to be representing for each line.
