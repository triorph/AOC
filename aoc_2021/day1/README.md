### Advent of code day 1

Data set is the depth to the floor of the ocean, from a sonar.

Day a) calculate how many times the data set increases from previous value to next.

Day b) calculate how many times a sliding window of 3 points increases from previous value to next.
Note: you only need to compare the left edge of that window to the right edge of the next, as the other points are in common and subtract from both sides. Basic algebra
