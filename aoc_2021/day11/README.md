Day 11

Octopi are flashing when they build up energy. They build up 1 energy a step, they need 10 energy to flash, and when they flash, they pass energy to all their neighbours, who may also flash
and pass to their neighbours. Excess energy returned back is lost, so all flashing octopi start their next step at 0 energy.

Part a:
Find out how many flashes have occurred after 100 iterations.

Part b:
Find out how steps have occurred when all the octopi have synchronised their flashing to occur in step


Had a lot of trouble dealing with mutable references being duped, which I think was solved by having the clojure end before the if statement opened, but was awkward regardless.
