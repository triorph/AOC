# Day 18

You need to ease the pressure inside a volcano. You see a bunch of caves, each
with a pressure valve that you can release. It takes a minute to walk between
caves, and a minute to open any valve. The pressure you release is a function of
how strong the valve is, and how early you reach it. E.g. if it has a flow rate
of 20, and you open it after 20 minutes, then 400 points of pressure are
released, but if you do the same one after minute 1, then only 20 points of
pressure are released.

Day a: What is the maximum amount of pressure you can release?

I must admit, I am a bit stumped here. I feel like the brute force approach will
quickly just not work at all, but not really sure how to optimise the path
values otherwise. The main advantage is that the input data is quite sparse,
with only a few high-release valves.
