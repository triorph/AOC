# Day 9

Rope follower. Or I guess you can think of it as making the pixels for a game of
snake look nice.

I think snake usually only moves directly left/right/up/down even on the
pieces, whereas this allows for diagonal movements which isn't quite the same,
but close enough.

Did part a at 10pm at night while mildly tipsy from work drinks, and looked at
day part b and realised its simple enough but also fiddly enough that I want to
sleep first. First thing in the morning I got it down, had 1 small problem with
selecting a 10 length tail instead of a 10 length rope, but the tests showed
that failure too which solved it.
