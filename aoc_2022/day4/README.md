# Day 4

Given a list of 2 sets of ranges, first count how many have full overlap, and
then how many have partial overlap.

This one was relatively easy (like still easy, but gave me less grief than
yesterday's), but I explored with using type definitions and implementing
traits on them. I was basically able to get the core stuff working without too
many syntax errors that I had to think about and get working, which was nice.

I did have one small guffaw in that the "tests" (e.g. the examples in the
adventofcode page) did not fully check the both sides of the partial overlap,
and I had assumed that only 1 side was needed where I was incorrect there.
