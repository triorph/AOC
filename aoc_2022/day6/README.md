# Day 6

Find how far into a string we have to go to get a completely different set of N
previous numbers
part a) For n=4,
Part b) for n=14

This one was pretty easy. Parsing was basically non-existent, and the logic was
so simple that I skipped actually checking the tests for part 2 and just chucked
the right answer into the page. Time taken around 24min.
